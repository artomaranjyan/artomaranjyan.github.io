<!-- I’m looking for summer internship opportunities.
If you have an opening or know of any, please don’t hesitate to contact me. -->

I'm a PhD student at KAUST, advised by [Prof. Peter Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/i_bio.html).
My research focuses on optimization for machine learning (ML) and federated learning (FL), where I contribute to the development of distributed and randomized optimization algorithms.
I’m currently focused on addressing **system heterogeneity issues** in distributed ML and FL, with an emphasis on **asynchronous methods**.

Before starting my PhD, I earned my MSc and BSc from Yerevan State University. 
During my bachelor's, I co-authored several papers in **Harmonic Analysis** under the guidance of [Prof. Martin Grigoryan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l-2JIPkAAAAJ&hl=en).


Outside of academics, I enjoy dancing bachata, playing [board games](https://boardgamearena.com/player?section=prestige), ultimate frisbee, and foosball.
