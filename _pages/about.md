<!-- I’m looking for summer internship opportunities.
If you have an opening or know of any, please don’t hesitate to contact me. -->


I’m a fresh PhD graduate in Computer Science from KAUST, where I was advised by [Prof. Peter Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/i_bio.html).
I work on optimization for machine learning and federated learning, with a focus on asynchronous and distributed algorithms that handle system and data heterogeneity.

Before my PhD, I earned both my MSc and BSc from Yerevan State University.
During my bachelor’s studies, I co-authored several papers in harmonic analysis under the supervision of [Prof. Martin Grigoryan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l-2JIPkAAAAJ&hl=en).

Outside of academics, I enjoy dancing bachata, playing [board games](https://boardgamearena.com/player?section=prestige), ultimate frisbee, and foosball.
