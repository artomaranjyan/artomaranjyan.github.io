<!-- I’m looking for summer internship opportunities.
If you have an opening or know of any, please don’t hesitate to contact me. -->

As I’m completing my PhD this year, I’m actively exploring **postdoc** and **research scientist** positions.


I’m a PhD student at KAUST, advised by [Peter Richtárik](https://richtarik.org/i_bio.html).
Recently, my focus has been on the theory and design of asynchronous optimization methods—developing efficient, scalable, and theoretically grounded algorithms.
More broadly, I work on optimization for machine learning and federated learning.


Before starting my PhD, I earned my MSc and BSc from Yerevan State University. 
During my bachelor's, I co-authored several papers in **Harmonic Analysis** under the guidance of [Prof. Martin Grigoryan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l-2JIPkAAAAJ&hl=en).


Outside of academics, I enjoy dancing bachata, playing [board games](https://boardgamearena.com/player?section=prestige), ultimate frisbee, and foosball.
