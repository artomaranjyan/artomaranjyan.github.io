I'll be giving a talk at the [AMCS/STAT graduate seminar at KAUST](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/events/by-type/graduate-seminar/2025/02/27/ringmaster-asgd-first-asynchronous-sgd-optimal-time) on February 27, presenting our paper, [Ringmaster ASGD: The First Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16168).
