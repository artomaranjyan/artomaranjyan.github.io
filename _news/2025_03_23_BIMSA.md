I spent two weeks visiting Yi-Shuai Niu at the Beijing Institute of Mathematical Sciences and Applications (BIMSA), collaborating on a project on Server-Assisted Federated Learning.
During the visit, I also gave talks at three universities: [PKU](https://artomaranjyan.github.io/assets/pdf/Peking_talk_announcment.jpg), [BUAA](https://math.buaa.edu.cn/info/1296/6437.htm), and [BIMSA](https://artomaranjyan.github.io/assets/pdf/BIMSA_talk_announcment.jpg).
