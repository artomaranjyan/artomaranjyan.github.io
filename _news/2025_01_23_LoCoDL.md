Our paper [LoCoDL: Communication-Efficient Distributed Learning with Local Training and Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04348)
by Laurent Condat, Peter Richtárik, and me,
has been accepted to ICLR 2025!

LoCoDL introduces a method that combines two key techniques—local training and communication compression—designed to reduce communication complexity in Federated Learning.
